# Fixed (Not fully (Only First Floor available for some reason)) version of Heavy Gullets from Prickly Team
This is fixed (At least for now) version of Heavy Gullets from Prickly Team.

**I'm not a author of the original gamemode! All credits go to https://steamcommunity.com/id/johnjoemcbob !**

**This gamemode requires this libary: https://github.com/handsomematt/3d2d-vgui**

**Just download the required library and place the 3d2dvgui.lua file in "garrysmod\lua\includes\modules"**

**Should be played on gm_flatgrass !**

**You can download this gamemode from the release tab or do it old way (see original text)**

There is still stack overflow bug however... 
I'm going try to fix it a bit later

Upd from 14.01.2022 - Finds out, the gamemode isn't actually random, i'm not sure what the problem is exactly, but i'm going to try to fix it
